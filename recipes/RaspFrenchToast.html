        <li>2 tablespoons vanilla extract</li>

        <li>1 loaf French bread, cut into 1 inch slices</li>
        <li>butter</li>

        <li>In a bowl, whisk milk, vanilla, sugar, and cinnamon into the beaten eggs until well blended. 
          Set aside. In a separate bowl, cream together raspberry puree and cream cheese until smooth.
          Make 'sandwiches' by cutting each slice of bread in half and spreading raspberry-cheese mixture in the center, then top with the other half.</li>
        <li>Melt butter over medium heat in a large skillet or griddle. Dip bread into egg mixture, coating thoroughly. 
          Cook until well-browned on both sides, about 5 minutes. Dust with confectioners' sugar and nutmeg. Serve immediately.</li>
